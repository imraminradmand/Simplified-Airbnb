# SIMPLIFIED... WELL VERY SIMPLIFIED AIRBNB PROJECT

~ In this project I have used React, Redux, Redux Persist, JWT and more to mimick something similar to Airbnb.
The goal with this project was to solidify my understanding of React and Redux outside of the work environment and create something that I think is cool, and wanted it to be something that I enjoyed working on.
This project was not meant to have the fanciest frontend/UI but rather the flow of data in the Redux Store. I have attached a link to the deployed version of this project, however the payment confirmation page will not work since the API that is used to get data is only for development purposes and will only return data when running on port 3000. </br></br>

~ The API that I have used is not very stable and has it's downtime, so if you try to make a reservation and it doesn't allow you, it's the API. Please try again later if you'd like to see that page.

~ Thanks for checking out the project, feel free to fork the repo if you'd like to add more features and create your own.
